### What is Python? Its Use Cases (Web, Data, Automation)

**Python** is a high-level, object-oriented programming language known for its **simplicity**, **readability**, and **versatility**. It supports multiple programming styles, including:

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- **Procedural Programming**
- **Functional Programming**

#### Common Use Cases of Python:

- **Web Development** – using frameworks like **Django**, **Flask**
- **Data Analysis & Visualization** – using **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**
- **Machine Learning & AI** – with **TensorFlow**, **Scikit-learn**, **PyTorch**
- **App Development** – building cross-platform apps with tools like **Kivy**
- **Game Development** – using **Pygame**
- **Creative Coding / Digital Art** – with **Turtle**, **Processing.py**
- **Automation & Scripting** – automating tasks, file operations, browser control

#### What is an Object-Oriented Language?

> An object-oriented language is a programming language that uses the concept of **objects** to design and organize code.  
> Objects are instances of **classes**, which are blueprints that define the **data (attributes)** and **behavior (methods)** of those objects.

### IDEs (Installing Python, VSCode / PyCharm)

To write and run Python code, you'll need two things:

1. **Python Interpreter**  
   - Download from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   - Make sure to check "Add Python to PATH" during installation

2. **An IDE or Code Editor**  
   - [**VSCode**](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) – Lightweight, fast, and beginner-friendly. Extensions available for Python.
   - [**PyCharm**](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/) – Full-featured IDE designed specifically for Python. Great for larger projects.

Both IDEs support features like syntax highlighting, linting, debugging, and more.

### First Code in Python

Here’s how to write and run your first Python program:

```python
# This is your first Python program
print("Hello, World!")
```

### To run this:

1. Save the file as `hello.py`
2. Open your terminal or command prompt
3. Navigate to the folder where the file is saved
4. Run the command:

```bash
python hello.py
```
You should see the output:

```bash 
Hello, World! 
```
