## Part B â€” Coding Exercises

### 1. **String Creation**

- Create 3 different strings using:
  - Single quotes
  - Double quotes
  - Triple quotes (multiline)

### 2. **Concatenation and Repetition**

- Concatenate two strings: `"Hello"` and `"World"`  
- Repeat the string `"ha"` 4 times

### 3. **String Indexing and Slicing**

Given `s = "Python Programming"`:

- Print the first character
- Print the last character
- Slice `"Python"` from the string
- Print the string in reverse
- Print every second character

### 4. **Using String Methods**

Given `text = "  Learn Python Programming  "`:

- Convert the text to lowercase
- Remove extra spaces from both sides
- Replace `"Python"` with `"C++"`
- Count how many times `"a"` appears

### 5. **Splitting and Joining**

Given: `sentence = "Python is easy to learn"`

- Split the sentence into a list of words
- Join the list back into a single string using `-` as a separator

### 6. **String Formatting**

- Use all 3 string formatting methods (`f-string`, `.format()`, and `%`) to print:  
  `"Hello, my name is Alex and I am 30 years old."`

### 7. **Escape Characters**

- Print:
```bash
Name: Alice
Age: 25
Location: New York\tUSA
```
